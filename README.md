# Client-side View Rendering Engine

This is a fast in-browser view rendering engine. The speed comes from a
template system that is specifically tailored for HTML views, and from
judicious use of modern DOM APIs and ES6 library functions.

The code should run in IE 11 and above, and in modern browsers (Chrome,
Firefox, Safari). Compatibility with older browsers should be possible via
polyfills.
